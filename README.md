<h1 align="center">GAME-ROOM Website</h1>

This is a website for an internet caf√©, a gathering place for PC gamers. The venue provides the use of their gaming PCs at a low cost and the store will hold regular gaming competitions with the latest PC hardware and games installed. It will be designed to be accessible and responsive on a range of devices, targeted mainly for customers who enjoy video gaming, socialising and competing.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are black, blue and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Encode Sans font was used for the text throughout the whole project, where as the Righteous font is used for the Title and headings. Sans Serif is used as the fallback for situations where the initial fonts were failing to process. I felt that the Righteous font had a distinct, "gamer" look where it was easy to read. The Encode Sans used for the text was not too eccentric and also easily readable.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I felt it was important to keep the images mainly on the darker side to coincide what an internet cafe would look like. They would typically be in dark rooms and with the hero images, opacity modifier was used to present this as well as the overlaying text to be easily displayed.

    -   Medium Device Wireframe - 

    -   Mobile Wireframe - 


## Features

### Existing Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes
-   Interactive elements
-   Carousel in the Games page to house images of games available. I felt this was neccessary to be more presentable and less cluttered.
-   On the Events page, I added a dropdown selection for the user to select which event they wish to enter.

### Features left to implement

-   A fixed "back to top" button for easier navigation.
-   A google maps feature to show location of the venue.
-   For small displays, the navigation expand animation is not as smooth as intended. This may be due to have two seperate lists integrated into one collapse.
