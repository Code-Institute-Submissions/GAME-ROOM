<h1 align="center">GAME-ROOM Website</h1>

This is a website for an internet café, a gathering place for PC gamers. The venue provides the use of their gaming PCs at a low cost and the store will hold regular gaming competitions with the latest PC hardware and games installed. It will be designed to be accessible and responsive on a range of devices, targeted mainly for customers who enjoy video gaming, socialising and competing.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are black with an opacity of 90%, soft blue and white. Having the background mainly in black gave the feel of an internet café, which are usually held in low-lit venues. The soft blue gave a type of neon colour which fits in-line with most gaming rigs with their RGB lights. I thought this combination worked well. A white font colour was used as with a black background, to make it easy to read.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Encode Sans font was used for the text throughout the whole project, where as the Righteous font is used for the Title and headings. Sans Serif is used as the fallback for situations where the initial fonts were failing to process. I felt that the Righteous font had a distinct, "gamer" look where it was easy to read. The Encode Sans used for the text was not too eccentric and also easily readable.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   I felt it was important to keep the images mainly on the darker side to coincide with what an internet cafe would look like. They would typically be in dark rooms and with the hero images, opacity modifier was used to present this as well as having the overlaying text to be easily displayed.

## Testing

   1. Using [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and  to ensure there were no syntax errors in the HTML code.

   1. For CSS, I used [W3C CSS Validator Services](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) An error showed that the CSS property "padding-inline-start" was not recognised. Having looked into this, the [Mozilla Developer site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding-inline-start#Browser_compatibility) describes this as an "experimental technology".

   2. Visually on mobile or similar sized devices, there will be a single column to display the content throughout the website for easier visibility.
For tablets and desktops, there are pages where columns are introduced which is assisted by the Bootstrap Grid System.

   3. Testing was performed using Google Chrome's device toggle feature. These include iPhones, Samsung Galaxy, iPad and iPad Pro.
Extensive testing to ensure the visual layout, as well as all links are directed to the correct page or websites (external websites are always automatically opened in a new tab). 
The documentation of the testing can be found [here](./readme-images/project-testing.pdf).



## Known Bugs

-   For small displays, the navigation expand animation is not as smooth as intended, you can notice a jitter upon expansion. The retraction, however, appears to be smooth. This may be due to have two seperate lists integrated into one collapse.
